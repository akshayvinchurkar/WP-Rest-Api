#WordPress Rest Api :fire:

Well :hatched_chick:**Wordpress Rest Api** Will Give you the power to extract the specific data From Your Site Or any other site before this comes in you have to 
be a php ninja to pull off all that data from any wordpress site that way you can create any thing with data.

Ok Lets take Example you have a site that runs on **WordPress** and you have another site which is your portfolio site and you want to
make a widget that shows your all latest posts that you publish on your **WordPress** site so what you do bump now you can do that
with WordPress Rest Api. REST stands for Representational state transfer and Api obviously stands for application programming interface.

**WordPress Rest Api** Not Only Allows you to view the Data But also You have power to write new and delete old data that means you can
do all that CRUD(Create,Update,Update,Delete) operation on data. 

if you used code editor called :octocat:Atom you check it if not because they have very cool native framework called :octocat:**Electron** Atom is Based on that Framework and its basically build that native frame for your os and inside
of that frame they run **complete web browser and its chrome so you get Everything** on top of that you can use node so its complete plus
may be you can called this is the future of desktop apps. so why i tell you all this is because someone wrote a app called "Calypso" which
takes a power of **WordPress Rest Api** and Create  desktop app with the help of Electron you should learn at lest give it a try to learn electron
and javascript now days you can almost anything with javascript is not about front end anymore with the help of node you can so anything from file
