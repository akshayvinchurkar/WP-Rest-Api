#WordPress Rest Api :fire:

Well :hatched_chick:**Wordpress Rest Api** Will Give you the power to extract the specific data From Your Site Or any other site. before this you have to 
be a php ninja to pull off all that data from any WordPress site that way you can create anything with that data.

Ok Lets take a Example you have a site that runs on **WordPress** and you have another site which is your Portfolio site and you want to
make a widget that shows your all latest posts that you publish on your **WordPress** site so what you do now bump. now you can do that
with WordPress Rest Api. REST stands for Representational state transfer and Api obviously stands for application programing interface.

**WordPress Rest Api** Not Only Allows you to view the Data But also You have power to do all that CRUD(Create,Update,Update,Delete) operation on that data. 

That's it i mean seriously the fun part comes in where i can do this in any language. ya! its Cool 

###and Now i am Talking about Javascript

if you heard about text editor called :octocat:Atom if not you should check it out. github have very cool native framework called :octocat:**Electron** Atom is Based on that Framework and its basically build that native frame for you and inside
of that frame you can run **complete web browser and its chrome so you get Everything** on top of that you can use node.js so its complete plus
may be you can called this is the future of desktop apps. 

so why i tell you all this is because someone wrote a app called "Calypso" which
takes a power of **WordPress Rest Api** and Create desktop app with the help of Electron. you should learn at least give it a try to learn electron but before that learn Javascript not just DOM Manipulation.

you can do almost anything with javascript is not about just Client Side Language with the help of node you can do anything from file access to OS related details almost anything.

I am Not just Write About What you can do? istead how you Do their is one more software which help you in your rest api journey which is **Postman** its chrome extension.
